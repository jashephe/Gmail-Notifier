#Gmail Notifier
###[Download](https://github.com/jashephe/Gmail-Notifier/releases)
Minimalist Gmail inbox notifications for Mac OS X.

##What Gmail Notifier is
Gmail Notifier is designed to replace [Google's Mac Notifier](http://toolbar.google.com/gmail-helper/notifier_mac.html).  It offers such improvements as Notification Center integration and OAuth2 authentication (which is nice as a general rule, but particularly so if you use 2-Factor Authentication, which you probably should).  It should currently be able to give you notifications of new messages pretty consistently, but has not been thoroughly tested, so please [file an issue](https://github.com/jashephe/Gmail-Notifier/issues) if you run across a bug.

## What Gmail Notifier is not
Gmail Notifier is not a fully-featured email client.  It cannot handle mailto: links (yet, but that's coming eventually), and cannot compose, display, or archive messages.  It simply reads your [Gmail Inbox Feed](https://mail.google.com/mail/feed/atom/), which only shows a list of unread messages in your inbox, with limited information on each message.  Gmail Notifier is for people who don't mind using Gmail's web interface, but like to get notifications about new emails, and would like to use notification center rather than whatever custom notification system rolls with [Google's Mac Notifier](http://toolbar.google.com/gmail-helper/notifier_mac.html).  Also, unlike Google's Mac Notifier, Gmail Notifier has nothing to do with your calendar.

## Building Gmail Notifier
Gmail Notifier is not a very complex project and shouldn't be too hard to build (if you have problems, please [file an issue](https://github.com/jashephe/Gmail-Notifier/issues)).  The one caveat is that you will need a Google API key.  All you have to do is head over to the [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com/project) and create a new API project.  There's no need for any special service access; just go to "APIs & auth" > "Credentials" in the sidebar and create a new client ID.  Make sure to set it to an "Installed application" of type "Other".  Then just copy GNAPIKeys_EXAMPLE.m in the source directory to GNAPIKeys.m, and change the keys to match what you got from the developer console.

##A Note on the Name
Gmail Notifier is not a Google product, nor is it in any way, shape, or form endorsed or recognized as an "official" Gmail client.  The name is simply intended to make it clear what services this application is intended to work with (i.e. Google's [Gmail](http://mail.google.com/)).
